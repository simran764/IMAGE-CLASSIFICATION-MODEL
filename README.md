# Description
The key objective of this task is to:

Understand the architecture and working of Convolutional Neural Networks.

Train a CNN on an image dataset to correctly classify images into categories.

Evaluate and interpret the modelâ€™s performance.

Develop familiarity with either TensorFlow (Keras API) or PyTorch for deep learning tasks.

Image classification is a foundational problem in computer vision and is used in various real-life applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, face recognition, and more.

Key Concepts
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
CNNs are a type of deep neural network designed specifically for working with image data. They are effective in detecting spatial hierarchies and patterns in images using layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

TensorFlow/PyTorch:
These are two of the most popular deep learning libraries. TensorFlow (with its high-level API Keras) provides a simple and flexible platform for quick prototyping, while PyTorch is known for its dynamic computational graph and flexibility, often preferred in research.

Image Classification:
Image classification involves assigning a label or class to an input image. For example, classifying handwritten digits, identifying animals in photos, or detecting disease in X-rays.

Steps for Implementation
Import Libraries:
Use necessary packages from TensorFlow or PyTorch, such as torch, torchvision, tensorflow.keras, and image handling libraries like matplotlib and numpy.

Dataset Selection and Loading:
Choose a well-known dataset such as:

MNIST (handwritten digits)

CIFAR-10 (images of 10 classes like airplane, cat, truck)

Fashion-MNIST (images of clothing items)

You can use torchvision.datasets or tensorflow.keras.datasets to load the dataset directly.

Data Preprocessing:

Normalize image pixel values (e.g., divide by 255).

Resize or crop images if needed.

Use data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping) to improve generalization.

Convert images to tensors and one-hot encode the labels if required.

Build the CNN Model:
A typical CNN consists of:

Convolutional Layers: to detect features

Activation Layers (ReLU): to add non-linearity

Pooling Layers (MaxPooling): to reduce dimensionality

Fully Connected Layers: to make final predictions

Softmax Output Layer: for multi-class classification

Compile and Train the Model:

Define a loss function such as categorical_crossentropy or cross_entropy.

Choose an optimizer (like Adam or SGD).

Train the model using the training data and validate it using a validation split.

Evaluate the Model:
Use test data to evaluate accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize performance using:

Confusion matrix

Accuracy/loss curves

Misclassified image samples

Fine-tuning (Optional):
Modify hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, number of epochs) to improve performance. Try adding more layers or dropout for regularization.

Deliverables
You are expected to submit a Jupyter Notebook that includes:

Full code for building and training the CNN.

Clear markdown explanations describing each step.

Visualizations of training metrics and test predictions.

Final performance evaluation of the model.
